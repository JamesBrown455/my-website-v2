              Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become an interesting and important area of research.  UAVs are used in military as well as civilian applications, such as search and rescue, structure inspection, and environmental surveying (Bio-Inspired).  The safety of UAVs in a variety of applications is a continuous concern.  Visual homing--the ability of the UAV to return to its starting position after having explored an area--could continue improving safety and practicality by preventing users from having to search in potentially dangerous areas to retrieve UAVs. Much of the research on visual homing has been implemented on ground robots.  Though research on visual navigation has been done on UAVs, these methods can be improved upon by combining techniques used across the literature.  Visual homing in the complete absence of GPS information and without the help of other navigation tools is an important problem to solve as it could continue to make UAVs easier and safer to use in a variety of applications.
