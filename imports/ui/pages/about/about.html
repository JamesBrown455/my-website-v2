            <h2>Who is the Man Behind the Curtain?</h2>
            <p>
              You have found your way to my website!  Congrats!
              But, I bet you are wondering who this James person is.
              Let me get you up to speed.
              My education started in a Connecticut high school that would not have been out of place in a John Hughes film.
              After high school, I made the decision to commute to Southern Connecticut State University, and live in my parents basement.
              For the past three years, I have worked toward my B.S. degree in Computer Science as a member of SCSUâ€™s Honors College.
              While at SCSU, I joined an honor society, ZDE, and worked as Assistant Probate Clerk for two years.
              Then during the summer before my senior year, I escaped my parents basement for eight weeks and traveled to Auburn, Alabama to research UAVs.
              Now, I have returned to my basement lair, and I am positioned to begin my senior year of school.

              For my final year at SCSU, I have begun to work on my senior honors thesis, as well as formulate my escape from my parents basement.
              My thesis will be focus on using machine learning to develop a smartphone user authentication system.
              My elaborate basement escape plan involves applying to masters programs in order to further my education on machine learning.
              If my plan succeeds, I will earn a masters degree, and be able to become the data scientist I aspire to be.

              Now, you have heard about James the student and the cellar dweller.
              What do I do for fun?  For starters I am a huge car enthusiast.
              I love anything to do with cars, and one of my major hobbies, photograph, stems from my passion.
              I love taking and editing the photos I take, so this year I started an Instagram page to share my car photos and adventures.
              Finally my other passion is the outdoors.
              Most weekends I can be found hiking, or camping, in the wilds of Connecticut and New York.
